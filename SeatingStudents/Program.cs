           /* Challenge
        Have the function SeatingStudents(arr) read the array of integers stored in arr which will be in the
        following format: [K, r1, r2, r3, ...] where K represents the number of desks in a classroom,
        and the rest of the integers in the array will be in sorted order and will represent the desks
         that are already occupied.All of the desks will be arranged in 2 columns, 
         where desk #1 is at the top left, desk #2 is at the top right, desk #3 is below #1, desk #4 is below #2, etc. 
         Your program should return the number of ways 2 students can be seated next to each other.
         This means 1 student is on the left and 1 student on the right, or 1 student is directly above or below the other student.
        For example: if arr is [12, 2, 6, 7, 11] then this classrooms looks like the following picture: 


        Based on above arrangement of occupied desks, there are a total of 6 ways to seat 2 new students next to each other.The combinations are: [1, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [8, 10], [9, 10], [10, 12]. So for this input your program should return 6. K will range from 2 to 24 and will always be an even number.After K, the number of occupied desks in the array can range from 0 to K. 
        Sample Test Cases
        Input:6, 4
        Output:4
        Input:8, 1, 8
        Output:6
